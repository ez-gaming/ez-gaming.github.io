## Why choose a PS Vita?
<center>
It is definitely better than a PSP. Better screen as well as having two analog stick which is very useful in some games. Being able to emulate PSP games means you have the best of both worlds. All the triple A titles of the PSP as well as all the best vita games are just within your reach. Having a modded vita opens to vast array of homebrews as well as free game (wink-wink). And while youâ€™re at it upgrade the vita memory to at least 128gb microsd using sd2vita solve the high priced vita memory cards. Run and install emulators to play your childhood retro games for nostalgia. A handheld gaming console that is way cheaper than a Nintendo switch and hundreds if not thousands of game available to play is safe to say a gamers dream handheld console.
